    "\n",
    "* A company that sells a single product would like to decide how many items it should have in inventory for each of the next n months. \n",
    "* The times between demands are IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) **exponential random variables** with a mean of 0.1 month. \n",
    "* The sizes of the demands, D, are IID **random variables** (independent of when the demands occur), with:\n",

    "where w.p. stands for _with probability_\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the beginning of each month, the company reviews the inventory level and decides how many items to order from its supplier. \n",
    "* If the company orders Z items, it incurs a cost of $K + iZ$, where $K = \\$32$ is the setup cost and $i = \\$3$ is the incremental cost per item ordered. (If Z = 0, no cost is incurred.) \n",
    "* When an order is placed, the time required for it to arrive (called the delivery lag or lead time) is **a random variable** that is distributed **uniformly** between 0.5 and 1 month. i.e., The company uses a stationary $(s,S)$ policy to decide how much to order. İ.e.,\n",

    "\n",
    "* When a demand occurs, it is satisfied immediately if the inventory level is at least as large as the demand. \n",
    "* If the demand exceeds the inventory level, theexcess of demand over supply is backlogged and satisfied by future deliveries. *(In this case, the new inventory level is equal to the old inventory level minus the demand size, resulting in a negative inventory leveL) *\n",
    "* When an order arrives, it is first used to eliminate as much of the backlog (if any) as possible; the remainder of the order (if any) is added to the inventory. \n",

    "* Let let $I(t)$  be the inventory level at time $t$. \n",

    "* and let $I^- (t) = max\\{ -l(t), O \\}$ be the backlog at time $t$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our model, \n",
    "\n",
    "* we shall assume that the company incurs a **_holding cost_** (rental,insurance, taxes, maintenance etc) of $h = \\$1$ per item per month held in (positive) inventory.  \n",
    "* since $I^+ (t)$ is the number of items held in inventory at time $t$, the time-average\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ {I}^+_{avg} = \\frac{\\int\\limits_0^n I^+ (t) \\ dt} {n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Thus, average holding cost per month is $h \\times {I}^+_{avg}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly;\n",
    "\n",
    "* suppose that the company incurs a backlog cost of $ k= \\$5 $ per item per month in backlog; this accounts for the cost of extra'record keeping when a backlog exists, as well as loss of customers' goodwill. \n",
    "* The time-average number of items in backlog is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {I}^-_{avg} = \\frac{\\int\\limits_0^n I^- (t) \\ dt} {n}$$\n",

    "* Assume that the initial inventory level is $I(0) = 60$ and that no order is outstanding. \n",
    "* We simulate the inventory system for n = 120 months and use the average total cost per month (which is the sum of the average ordering cost per month, the average holding cost per month, and the average shortage cost per month) to compare the following nine inventory policies:\n",

    "1. The interdemand times are distributed exponentially,  \n",
    "2. The demand-size random variate $D$ must be discrete, as described above, and can be generated using weighted uniform random generator. 4 weights $[1/6, 1/3, 1/3, 1/6]$ will be assigned to four values $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ \n",
    "3. The delivery lags are uniformly distributed, but not over the unit interval $[0,1]$. In general, we can generate a random variate distributed uniformly over any interval $[a, b]$. So in this case the interval is $[0.5, 1.0]$ in months\n"
