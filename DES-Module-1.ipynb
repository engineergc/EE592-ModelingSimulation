    "# Advanced Modeling and Simulation Course\n",
    "### Instructor: Dr. M. Nedim ALPDEMÄ°R\n",
    "The first part of the exercises contains examples of Discrete Event Simulation.\n",
    "For this part we use an open source Discrete Event Simulation package written in Python called __SimPy__\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtaining SimPy\n",
    "[SimPy is available from https://pypi.org/project/simpy/](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples in this part start with a relatively simple problem and increase in complexity as we move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief introduction to SimPy Basic Concepts\n",
    "* The behavior of active components (like vehicles, customers or messages) is modeled with ___processes___. \n",
    "* All processes live in an ___environment___. \n",
    "* They interact with the environment and with each other via ___events___.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processes\n",
    "* Processes are described by simple Python **generators**. \n",
    "* You can call them process function or process method, depending on whether it is a normal function or method of a class. \n",
    "* During their lifetime, they create **events** and **yield** them in order to wait for them to be **triggered**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Events\n",
    "* When a process yields an event, the process gets suspended. \n",
    "* SimPy resumes the process, when the event occurs (we say that the event is triggered). \n",
    "* Multiple processes can wait for the same event. SimPy resumes them in the same order in which they yielded that event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Management\n",
    "* An important event type is the **Timeout**. \n",
    "* Events of this type are triggered after a certain amount of (simulated) time has passed. \n",
    "* They allow a process to sleep (or hold its state) for the given time. A Timeout and all other events can be created by calling the appropriate method of the Environment that the process lives in (Environment.timeout() for example).\n",

    "  * A gas station has a limited number of gas pumps that share a common fuel reservoir. Cars randomly arrive at the gas station, request one of the fuel pumps and start refueling from that reservoir.\n",
